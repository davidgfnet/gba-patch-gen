GBA patch generation
====================

This repo contains a set of tools to generate patches for GBA ROMs. The purpose
of these patches is to enable games running on Supercard devices. However some
of the tools can be used for other kinds of flash cart devices.

This repo is meant for developers mostly (at least for now).
